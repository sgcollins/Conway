The output of the program could be something like:

 XOOXOOXXXXXXXXXXXX
 XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
 OOOOOOOXXXXXOOOOOO
 XXXXXOOOXXXXOOOXXX
 etc...

It would be a good idea to make a function for printing an array of boolean
characters.  The function's arguments could include characters to be used to 
represent true and false.
